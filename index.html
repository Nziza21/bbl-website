        <p>
        BIG BRAIN LEADERS are dedicated to tackling youth unemployment in Rwanda by empowering young people with the skills and resources to transform organic waste into certified compost. Through this sustainable process, we create meaningful job opportunities that not only provide livelihoods but also support local agriculture by improving soil health and crop yields. Our mission is to build a greener, more prosperous Rwanda where youth are at the forefront of environmental innovation and economic growth.

      <div class="text-block">
        <p>
         Rwanda produces over 600 tons of waste daily, with about 80% being organic. Despite this large quantity, most organic waste goes unused and contributes to environmental pollution. At the same time, youth unemployment remains a significant challenge, limiting opportunities for skills development and income generation. Additionally, Rwandan farmers heavily rely on imported chemical fertilizers, which are costly and not always sustainable for the environment. This situation creates an urgent need for innovative solutions that turn organic waste into valuable resources while empowering youth and supporting local agriculture.

      <h3>Challenge 4: The Interview</h3>
      <p>In this challenge, we interviewed a local entrepreneur outside ALU to learn about their business journey. We explored how they started, their motivation for tackling a specific global challenge, daily operations, challenges faced, success stories, and future plans. Our findings were compiled into a visually engaging slide deck addressing all key points. We reflected as a team on how these insights can guide our own entrepreneurial path. We documented the interview process with photos and videos, posting a concise video on YouTube and Instagram, tagging alupreneurship as required. At least two team members participated visibly in the interview and reflection.</p>
